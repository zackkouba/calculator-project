# calculator-project (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
Personal project to explore base line HTML, CSS, and JavaScript capabilities.

This calculator utilizes a single string input at the top which is added to and removed from using the
buttons on the calculator.

The equals button simply reads the input string line at the top and uses the eval() function to evaluate
the contents of it and return the calculator's value.
